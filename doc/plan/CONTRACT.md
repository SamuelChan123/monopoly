We as Monopoly Team 6 agree to the following terms and conditions:
1. Team meetings: Meet once a week as a whole group, for people collaborating on certain parts together, can meet separately, mostly work independently. Sunday afternoons/evenings work best (around 3pm for ~2 hours). Book a room in the link or in Perkins library. If a team member can?t make it, please let the rest of the team know as soon as possible and try to skype/facetime in if possible (or other communication channels)
2. Communications: Preferred channel of communication will be Facebook Messenger, but we have left phone numbers and netIDs for other mediums of communication if Facebook does not work out for whatever reason. Please respond as reasonably soon as possible to direct queries or team demands (preferably within a span of 2-3 hrs during the project week and 1 hr near the deadline).
3. Helping each other: Each team member will ask for help when needed, each team member will "go above and beyond" as needed to support the team.
4. Commitments: Each team member will do work to the best of his/her ability and on time and provide commitments others on the team can rely on. Failure to meet commitments will be first talk amongst each other and communicate problems/resolve conflicts, then go to Prof Duvall and/or teaching staff if we cannot resolve amongst ourselves.
