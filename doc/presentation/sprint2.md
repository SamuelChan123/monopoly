#Monopoly: Team 6 Sprint 2 Presentation


##Sprint 1 Objectives Completed

- Being able to start and continue games (multiple players, taking turns, rolling die, choosing options)
- Make working visuals and GUI
- Setting up configurations/csv/properties files
- Working backbone with basic working UI buttons 
- Setting up Splash Screens and setting up game parameters
- Working win/loss conditions

##Sprint 2 Goals
- Full working original 40-tile game with modifiable parameters
- Working loadable implementations of 1-2 other game variations (house rules, triopoly... etc)
- Interactive game GUI (board, properties, changing settings)
- Finishing up special features of the game (rolling doubles, free parking variations, user options (tokens, jail options... etc))
- Setting up CPU players and conditional decisions

##Sprint 2 Objectives Completed
- Fully/nearly working original 40-tile game with modifiable parameters (i.e. cheat codes)
- Some implementation of a second game variation (Junior Monopoly)
- Rolling specials implemented

##Program Bugs/Improvements
- View doesn?t display multiple player chips when multiple players are on one tile
Can still build houses even when do not own all the properties of one property group (neighborhoods)
- Abstractions?

##Revisiting Design Goals
- revisit the project's design goals: is it as flexible/open as you expected it to be and how have you fixed/closed the core implementation in a data driven way?


##APIs in Detail

####Dice (From first presentation)
- Java Code for the API
- what service does it provide?
- how does it provide for extension?
- how has it changed (if at all)?
- how does it support users (your team mates) to write readable, well design code?

- how does it support users (your team mates) to write readable, well design code?

##Use cases for API Implementation

- show two use cases implemented in Java code in detail that show off how to use the APIs you described
- describe one element of the design that has changed based on your deeper understanding of the project, how were those changes discussed, and what trade-offs ultimately led to the changes


##Final Sprint Goals
- Easter Eggs/Beautification 
- Challenge Features: Auctions/Trading, Player Profiles, Saving games
- Working Multiple Games with markedly different implementations
- Wrapping up and adding new features
